# Udacity-Memory-Game

After many failed attempts at the Memory Game Project, I began following Matthew Cranford's tutorial, which was excellent. I needed the extra walkthrough to really understand what was going on and what needed to be implemented.

Please see comments in .js file for functionalities still in need of debugging. Submitting as is, as I am running out of time and have spent weeks trying to figure this particular project out.
